basic audio testing example for playdate simulator (installable from here: https://play.date/dev/) 
 
playdate uses "pdx" files as its game format. this is really just a glorified directory with some special files in it.

to test out, just copy an mp3 named 'potato.mp3' into the audio_test.pdx directory and launch with the simulator opening audio_test.pdx
